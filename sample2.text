What Happens When Term Life Insurance Is Paid Up ?
Actually term life insurance can not be paid up . 
Term Life Insurance does not have the option to become paid up , like permanent life insurance does . 
That is an excellent question ! One of two things will happen . If the policy was paid up long ago , and has remained in effect , then it acts like any other policy , and when the insured passes , it pays out .
A life insurance policy is paid up when all required annual premiums have been paid . If the policy is a `` whole life paid up at age 95 '' contract , the policy is paid up at age 95 . It is important to note that the term `` paid up '' is often misused .
